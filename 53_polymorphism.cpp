//! Difference between runtime and compile time
/*
 * 1. Runtime and compile time refer to different stages of the software development process.
 * 2. Compile time is the period during which source code is converted into an executable format by a compiler.
 * 3. This happens before the program is run. On the other hand, runtime is the period during which the program is actually being executed by the computer.
 * 4. At runtime, the program is read and executed line by line by the computer's processor.
 * 5. Errors that occur during runtime are referred to as "runtime errors."
 * 6. Compile-time errors are errors that are detected by the compiler, when the source code is being translated into executable code.
